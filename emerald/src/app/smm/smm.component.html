                        <li><b>Increases brand awareness: </b> <span class="font-weight-light">
                                Social media is one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing 
                                methods used to syndicate content and increase your business' visibility.
                                 Implementing a social media strategy will greatly increase your 
                                 brand recognition since you will be engaging with a broad 
                                 audience of consumers. To get started, create social media
                                  profiles for your business and begin interacting with others.
                                   Get employees, business partners, and sponsors to "like" and "share" your page.
                                    Simply having people interact with your content will increase brand awareness and
                                     begin building your reputation as a business. Each post that is shared will be
                                      introduced to a new network of individuals, which can lead them to becoming
                                       potential customers, and the more people who know about your business, the better.
                                        By investing only a few hours per week, over 91% of marketers claimed that their
                                         social marketing efforts greatly increased their exposure. There is no doubt that
                                          by simply having a social media page your brand will benefit, and with regular use
                                           it can generate a wide audience for your business.

                        <li><b>More inbound traffic: </b> <span class="font-weight-light">
                                Without marketing your business on social media, your inbound traffic 
                                is limited to your usual customers. The people familiar with your brand
                                 are likely searching for the same keywords you already rank for. Without
                                  utilizing social media as part of your marketing strategy, you'll have much
                                   more difficulty reaching anyone outside of your loyal customer circle
                                   . Every social media profile you add to your marketing mix is a gateway 
                                   to your website, and every piece of content you post is another opportunity 
                                   to acquire a new customer. Social media is a melting pot of different types of
                                    people with varying backgrounds and behaviors. With different people come
                                     different needs and different ways of thinking. Syndicating your content
                                      on as many platforms as possible allows these individuals to organically
                                       reach your business. For instance, perhaps someone in an older demographic 
                                       of consumers will search for your website using a particular keyword on Facebook,
                                        but a millennial could begin their search by using a different social media
                                         platform entirely, because they search for products totally differently. 
                                         By marketing on social media you can effectively open your business to a wider variety
                                          of versatile consumers all over the world.

                        <li><b>Improved search rankings: </b> <span class="font-weight-light">
                                Although posting on social media might get your business some site traffic, more effort than 
                                that is required to see significant success. Search engine optimization is very important for 
                                achieving higher page rankings and obtaining traffic to your business website. While social 
                                media doesn't directly increase search engine rankings, Social Media Examiner states that more 
                                than 58% of marketers who have been using social media for one year or longer still see improved 
                                search engine rankings. Being able to rank in the top positions for your keywords will revolutionize
                                 your traffic and continue to generate positive results for your business. Let's face it, everyone uses
                                  Google to find information, and they likely won't navigate past page 1 because their answer normally 
                                  is on the first page of results. If your business website isn't ranked towards the top of search engine 
                                  results, you should probably adjust your search engine optimization strategy. To give yourself the best 
                                  chance of ranking better through social media, create high quality content that integrates your
                                   targeted keywords. Content such as blogs, infographics, case studies, business information, 
                                   and employee photos will make your business's social media profile intriguing and credible.
                                    Once you begin posting quality content, you'll begin to build a social media community where 
                                    followers will "like" and "share" your content. Most importantly, it gives you more opportunities 
                                    to get in front of industry influencers who will write about your
                                 business and provide links back - which will help to directly increase search engine rankings.

                        <li><b>Better customer satisfaction: </b> <span class="font-weight-light">
                                Social media is a networking and communication platform. Creating a 
                                voice for your company through these platforms is important in humanizing your company.
                                 Customers appreciate knowing that when they post comments on your pages, they will receive
                                  a personalized response rather than an automated message. Being able to acknowledge each
                                   comment shows that you are attentive of your visitors' needs and aim to provide the best experience.
                                customer on social media.
                                Every customer interaction on your business's social media accounts is an opportunity to 
                                publicly demonstrate your compassion for your customers. Whether an individual has a question or 
                                a complaint, social media allows you to address the matter using interpersonal dialogue. A brand
                                 devoted to customer satisfaction that takes the time to compose personal messages will inherently 
                                 be viewed in a positive light, even if responding to a customer complaint.

                        <li><b>More brand authority: </b> <span class="font-weight-light">
                                Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty both play a part in making your business more authoritative,
                                 but it all comes down to communication. When consumers see your company posting on social media, 
                                 especially replying to customers and posting original content, it makes you appear more credible. 
                                 Regularly interacting with customers demonstrates that your business cares about customer satisfaction, 
                                 and is available to answer any questions that they might have. Satisfied customers are eager to spread the
                                  word about a great product or service and they usually turn to social media to express their opinion.
                                   Having customers mention your business on social media will advertise your business, and show new
                                    visitors your value and brand authority. Once you obtain a few satisfied customers who are vocal
                                     about their positive purchase experience, you can let the advertising be done for you by actual
                                      customers who enjoyed your product or service.
