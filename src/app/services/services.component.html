            Is SEO Important for Every Business?

Does SEO matter for every business, or do only a select few need it? Do you really need to invest in search engine optimization, or can you get by without it?

If you’re asking questions like these, you’re in the right place. As experts in the field of SEO, or search engine optimization, we know that the right SEO can make or break a business online. On this page, we’ll explain why SEO is important, which businesses need it, and offer some resources so you can explore the topic further.

Let’s get started with an explanation of how SEO works, and how it impacts your website’s rankings in the first place. If you'd like to speak with one of our Internet marketing experts, you can reach us at 855-601-5359.

How Does SEO Work?

SEO consists of multiple strategies, actions, and best practices, all of which have the end goal of improving your website’s position in search engines—which is why it’s called “search engine optimization.”

There are two kinds of SEO: on-page and off-page. On-page SEO consists of anything you can control on your own website to improve your rankings. This refers to things like site speed, keyword presence, header text, and so on. On the other hand, off-page SEO consists of anything done on other websites that may influence your rankings. Generally, this only refers to links.

It takes time, knowledge of SEO, and successful implementation of the desired on- and off-page SEO factors to optimize your website for high rankings in search engines. If the collective power of your site or an individual page’s SEO is more powerful than all others, with regards to a specific query, you’ll rank #1.

Because SEO involves so many ranking factors, you can think of the #1 site as winning a triathlon of sorts. In a real triathlon, the winner of the running portion is not necessarily the winner of the entire race – and so it is the same with SEO. The site with the most links, the most pages, or the most visitors is not necessarily the #1 site. Their overall performance determines who comes out on top.
Why is SEO Important?

SEO is Google’s way of determining which sites deserve to rank highly for each query entered into its search engine. Without modern SEO, it would be extremely simple to manipulate the search results so that the site with the most links or the most pages—all easily generated by software—consistently ranked #1.

SEO is important because it keeps the search results fair. It reduces the ability to manipulate these results as much as possible, so that the sites appearing for each search are there because they deserve to be there. Hard work and a website that appeals to visitors correlate with high search engine rankings, so if your site meets these criteria, you’ll have a better chance at showing up in the results.

Users trust search engines, and achieving a top spot in search engine rankings signals to searchers that your site is a credible source. The higher you rank in results pages, the more clicks and traffic your site will generate. SEO also improves user experience, making it more likely for customers to become repeat buyers.

And SEO is cost-effective. Competitive industries can spend large amounts of money on paid website traffic. Of course, you can still purchase ad space, but if you’re working with a tight budget, SEO is a great way to drive qualified traffic to your site without directly paying for it.
What Search Would Be Like Without SEO

Without SEO, it’s hard to say how we would ever find websites, businesses, or the information we seek on a daily basis. The search engine results would be too easy to manipulate, and as users, we would have to look much longer and harder to find valuable sites instead of the ones simply manipulating the results to get to the first page.

Basically, SEO is important because it ensures that typical people don’t have to search for more than a few seconds to find the information or products they want. It establishes a sort of “natural order” online that would be missing without it.
Marketers Believe SEO is Crucial

Additionally, many marketers find that SEO is crucial to their work. This chart shows that 50% of marketers believe SEO is the most effective digital marketing strategy.

As you can see, SEO is very important—and without it, you might even be spending too much money on other marketing activities!
Is SEO Important for Every Kind of Business?

If you're reading this article, you may be wondering if SEO is really all that important for you. You may have a business in an industry where there’s little to no competition, so you might already be ranking #1. Or you may be struggling to rank at all, and are wondering if there are options other than SEO out there to get you the visibility you need.

No matter what your situation is, if you have a website for your company, SEO is important. Whether your business is new or old, struggling or successful, small or large, SEO is crucial to your online success. In fact, even if you are the only one in your industry, SEO is still important.

Here are a few examples of industries and businesses that can benefit from SEO:

    Manufacturing
    Healthcare
    Retail
    Home services
    HVAC
    And more

Why is that? It’s because of one very important reason: your SEO is something you can control.

There are many things about your business that you can’t control. You can’t control when a new competitor appears, how well your customers react to a new product launch, or your quarterly profits.

But with SEO, you can control your rankings. And this means, to some extent, you can control how many visitors come to your website, which directly impacts how many online sales or leads you get, which impacts the amount of money you can make from being online.

If you invest in your website’s search engine optimization, you are making a direct investment in its visibility and profitability. So no matter what happens tomorrow, if your SEO is constant, you can count on that visibility to help your business grow and prosper.

This is why SEO is so important, no matter what your business does. And based on the way search engines are developing, it’s unlikely that SEO will lose importance any time soon.

Is SEO More Important for Some Businesses Than Others?

You may be wondering if investing in your website’s SEO is really all that important. Do some businesses or industries need search engine optimization more than others?

Every website has different needs, when it comes to SEO. But it’s rarely the business or industry that determines those needs. It’s typically factors like:

    The website’s stage in the growth process
    How visitors are reacting to the website
    What keywords the business wants to rank for
    The amount of competition for those keywords
    Whether or not any SEO has been done in the past
    Whether or not the site is under any kind of Google penalty

Where the industry can have an impact is with regards to competition. If you are creating an online jewelry store and are determined to rank for the keyword “jewelry,” your SEO is going to be more costly, and more time-consuming, than SEO for a jewelry store for children targeting “fine children’s jewelry.” This is because the competition on that first keyword is much, much higher—so it will take much more work to break into the top positions.

This doesn’t make SEO any more important for your jewelry site, though. It just means it’s more of a challenge. SEO is just as important for every business, no matter its industry or competition. Again, this is because you can’t control many of the factors that surround you, but you can control your SEO. And if you could directly influence your website’s traffic, ranking, and sales or leads... why wouldn’t you?

            Why Social Media Is Important for Business Marketing
By Guest Author on August 9, 2018 in Content Marketing

    Content Marketing

    Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Pocket

Let’s start with one simple fact: your business needs a social media presence.

It doesn’t matter if you run a small local shop or a big national company. Social media is an essential piece of your business marketing strategy.

Social platforms help you connect with your customers, increase awareness about your brand, and boost your leads and sales. With more than three billion people around the world using social media every month, it’s no passing trend.

What you might not know is that you’re ready to get your company’s social media off the ground right now. You don’t need to know every intimidating buzzword or have the magic number of followers. You can get started immediately—and even enjoy yourself in the process.

Here are six reasons why investing in social media is a wise business move.
1. Build Awareness

If people don’t know about your business, they can’t become your customers. Social media boosts your visibility among potential customers, letting you reach a wide audience by using a large amount of time and effort. And it’s free to create a business profile on all the major social networks, so you have nothing to lose.

Define what you want to get out of social media to develop a social media strategy. Do you want new customers to discover your services? Do you hope to bring more local shoppers into your stores? By keeping your strategy specific, you can determine which social media channels are the best fit for your business.
2. Communicate Authority

Customers are increasingly savvier and more discerning about which businesses they support. Before making a decision, they’ll do a quick search to browse your website and social media.

Will they find an empty storefront or a rich source of information? Setting up robust profiles that you update frequently with relevant content will build your brand’s authority and make sure you make a positive first impression through social media, showing that your business is trustworthy, knowledgeable, and approachable.

Look for ways to demonstrate your expertise as a thought leader in your industry—like writing pieces related to your expertise or expanding on your company’s mission. By showing what your business offers and values, you will establish confidence in potential customers.
3. Show Authenticity

Customers aren’t interested in businesses that publish dry, corporate-style social media posts.

Instead, let your brand’s personality shine through in everything you share on social media. What does your brand voice sound like? How does it represent who you are?

Practice getting your tone just right, whether it’s casual and funny or formal and friendly. Be true to who you are, not who you think you should be. Followers want to see real people behind your social profiles. Show them.
4. Encourage Engagement

Social channels evolve, constantly releasing new features, and this rapidly changing environment can be intimidating for some business owners.

But remember: you don’t have to do everything. Play with new ways to connect with your audience, and give yourself permission to learn as you go. One day, you could post a series of Instagram Stories to give customers a behind-the-scenes tour of your office. The next, you could host a quick Q&A session via Facebook Live video streaming. Over time, you’ll get a better idea of your followers’ preferences.

You can create engaging video content for social media with a simple setup—good lighting, a smartphone, and a tripod. Also, do a test run before you go live to make sure your internet connection or hotspot has enough speed to avoid delays and interruptions.
5. Provide Support

Social platforms have successfully broken down barriers between companies and their customers. Now, instead of calling a customer service line, many people turn to Facebook or Twitter to solve problems or find information.

Develop your reputation as a responsive, caring brand by offering support through social channels:

    Create a system for tracking customer comments, questions, and complaints on social media.
    Respond as quickly as possible to questions and concerns.
    Go out of your way to be positive and helpful.
    Listen to criticism and make customers feel heard.
    Know when to resolve public conversations in private messages.

6. Grow Affordably

Marketing costs add up, and not every business can afford huge campaigns. But you can get a lot of value for your dollar with social media advertising. Your business, regardless of size or budget, has an opportunity to grow your audience and reach your objectives through ads on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

When building an ad campaign, know who you’re trying to reach and what goal you want to achieve so you don’t waste any of your budget on unhelpful advertising. Avoid overly salesy ads, and opt for content that educates or entertains (or does both at the same time).

Social media is a crucial part of your business marketing, but it doesn’t have to be stressful to manage. Take the first step, create a profile, and start engaging with your customers.
